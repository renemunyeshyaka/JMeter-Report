Firstly, forke
Dowload
and unzip the JMeterReport.zip file.
Inside JMeterReport folder, you have two subfolders (html and OutputReport) and two additional files (testplan1.jmx and View Results in Table.jmx)
In the folder html you have whole the report in htlm format.
In OutputReport you have testresults.csv which is important to create the whole html report.
All chats are in the html folder. You can access them by opening index.html file, inside html folder.
